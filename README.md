# 👋 Hi, I’m Sachram (aka Minibunny)

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an engineering student passionate about embedded systems, automation, space exploration, and creative software development.

---

## 👀 I’m interested in:
- 🚀 Space systems engineering and sustainability in extraterrestrial environments  
- 🤖 Embedded systems and automation (Arduino, STM32)  
- 🕹️ Java-based game development and interactive interfaces  
- 🌿 Smart home technologies and environmental monitoring  
- 🧠 Machine learning and Python scripting  

---

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Real-time systems and low-level microcontroller programming  
- Signal and image processing for sensor applications  
- Cloud deployment and API design with Docker and AWS  
- GUI development in Java and responsive interface design  

---

## 💼 Notable Projects:

- **🚨 [Laser Based Obstruction Detection System](https://github.com/Minibunny14/Laser-Based-Obstruction-Detection-System)**
  
  An embedded C project using laser sensors to detect blockages on a conveyor belt. Triggers alarms in real-time to alert operators. Currently being tested at Balesses Kitchen Ltd.

- **🏡 [HomeSentinel](https://github.com/Minibunny14/HomeSentinel)**
  
  A smart home monitoring system designed to track environmental parameters (like temperature and gas levels) using sensors. Sends alerts and logs data, built for real-world integration with embedded platforms.

- **🌱 [AgroMatic](https://github.com/Minibunny14/Agro_Matic)**
  
  AgroMatic is a decentralized smart irrigation system using ESP32 modules with ESP-NOW communication. Each battery-powered slave node autonomously controls watering based on soil moisture, while a master hub aggregates data for cloud monitoring. The system cuts water waste by 30% and scales effortlessly across farms without WiFi dependency.

- **🤖 [Repository Of Knowledge STM32](https://github.com/Minibunny14/Repository_Of_Knowledge-STM32-)**
  
  This STM32 knowledge repository provides a comprehensive overview of STM32 microcontrollers, focusing on their ARM Cortex-M architecture, built-in peripherals, and development tools like STM32CubeIDE and STM32CubeMX.

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Embedded systems for smart homes, wearables, or space habitats  
- Open-source automation tools or simulations  
- Real-world sensor integration and alert systems
